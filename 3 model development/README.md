Due to the high memory of some files I omitted that but I left the folder where in theory should have been.
* "../3 model development/structure/pretrained_v2" it has the role of collecting the trained models. In the code for "2 training.py" I added an option for re-train again from zero starting with "gpt2"
* in the folder "../3 model development/structure/csv" I ziped the _"training_set_gpt2.csv"_
