A multi-mode demultiplexers (demux) is coupled to the receiver head via a multi-mode fiber to generate a number of optical signals based on the FSO signal. A number of repeaters modify the optical signals and generate a number of single-mode optical signals.,"['A', 'Write a patent with these nouns: demux, fiber, multiplexing, wavelength, signal, repeaters, division, space, demultiplexers, number, receiver, signals, head, mode. <|endoftext|>|startoftext|> A voltage threshold generator (170) having improved reliability as well as substantially increased EGRV operates with 10 to 110 basis percent percent on energy applied (VAvg. Nbd. Lbd. Yc), 12 to 99 basis percent, relative to the average CFP, to produce a signal for at least two phases (473 to 732; 800 to 748) immediately preceding a switching operation in either condition of or attachment thereto. The power distribution over each phase is indicated as alternating such signals from the host signal carrying 20,000 voltages at one time as change during the switching operation. <|endoftext|>']",[[7.42299219]],0.17447802
