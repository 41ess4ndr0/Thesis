446770," The present invention is directed to a process for amplifying any desired specific nucleic acid sequence contained in a nucleic acid or mixture thereof. The process comprises treating separate complementary strands of the nucleic acid with a molar excess of two oligonucleotide primers, and extending the primers to form complementary primer extension products which act as templates for synthesizing the desired nucleic acid sequence. The steps of the reaction may be carried out stepwise or simultaneously and can be repeated as often as desired. ",Process for amplifying nucleic acid sequences,2.669286
